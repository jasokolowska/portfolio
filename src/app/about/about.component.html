    Back when I was a Process Engineer, managing projects and
    designing systems, I discovered my passion for coding. That curiosity led me
    to software development, where I now focus on creating
    <strong>backend systems</strong> using <strong>Java</strong> and
    <strong>Kotlin</strong> that are scalable and maintainable, with a strong
    foundation in <strong>best practices</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m also capable of handling <strong>frontend work</strong> with
    <strong>Angular</strong> when needed, but my heart lies in
    <strong>backend architecture</strong> and
    <strong>team collaboration</strong>. My approach is simple: with the right
    mindset and teamwork, anything can be built. I continue to learn, driven by
    a love for solving complex challenges and delivering
    <strong>efficient, user-centered solutions</strong>.

  <p>
    When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, spending
    time with my kids, or working on <strong>DIY projects</strong> in my
    workshop.
